# Proposal: What Should My Resume Page Look Like?

## Overview
This proposal intend to be a design blueprint for the third assignment. It answers a question: What should my resume look like, based on the existing template. It consists of the following parts:
 First it describes the requirement of a resume, what kind of goals it should achieve. Second, it outlines the solution to resolve the requirements. Third, it outlines a detail plan of the implementation of the resume.

## Requirements and Goals
As discussed with Pendar, the out come of the project should serve as a Google internal resume site for me to use. And it should be very easy to reuse by other Googler with similar background. In particular, it has the following goals:
 - Demonstrate the technical strengths I accumulate through each project, identify the challenge in Knowledge, Complexity, Scope, and demonstrate the impact of the projects.
 - The form of resume site should be adapative to the content, it should be very easy to revise and update the content, and also easy to update the appearance of the resume.
 - The resume should be able to present multimedia content like pictures and videos so that we can easily present demo of project in ways easier to understand.
 - The resume should be clear, brief and aesthetically pleasing.
 - The resume should work responsively, should render perfectly on mobile devices.
 - The resume should be fast and smooth to load
 - The resume should be easy to implement given the current template


## Plan of Implementation
We will implement a web page of resume. It will contain the following parts:
- a list of projects that I contributed to, it will be 3 levels deep
- a list of documentation that I wrote, we will use the *experience* section from template
- a list of hornors, we will use the *portfolio* section from template
- a list of previous experience, we will use the *experience* section

The current template does not work quite well for projects section and the documentation section, we will tweak it a little bit. 

[Asking for suggestion]: I need some inspiration how we can present the projects and documentation
