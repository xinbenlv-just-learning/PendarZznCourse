The second assignment is to propose a plan to refine and update the resume, based on the template we just created in Week 1.

"for week 2, I want you to come up with a proposal of how you want to change this resume template to make it work with 'your' data. you don't have to program anything at this point.
the proposal can be a text document, you can also include hand-drawn sketches if you think it will help explain you design choices better. once you have a proposal, we can review it"
