## 2. Document the tricky things during implementation (also served as a todo list)
* if you want to have a full page, you will have to use javascript to set the height
* TODO change font-size based on screensize

## 3. Questions to ask
* Question: (css) in .title-box, it seems I will have to add left:0 and right:0 to make the auto margin take effect, why?
* Question: How margin auto is determined
* Question: On aliment, box-border etc, what is a good practice to achieve pixel perfect.

## 4. Known Issue (I don't plan to fix)
1. First page box "top" is different
2. First page Image fill background
[pendar]: suggesting using css's background-size: cover, or use jquery's  imagefill.js http://johnpolacek.github.io/imagefill.js/
3. When less than 767px wide the solution's education experience's red round bubble's text is not vertical aligned
